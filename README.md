TMiP 2019 treasure punt
=======================
On 31 August 2019, the [TMiP 2019](http://talkingmathsinpublic.uk/) treasure punt took place in Cambridge.
Groups of up to 6 people punted up the river Cam, and collected clues to the code of a comination lock they had been given.

This repository contains the LaTeX code to make the instructions for the treasure punt, and a Python script that confirms that the puzzle has exactly one solution.
